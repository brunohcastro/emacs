# My emacs config

This emacs config was forked from the great config that can be found
on https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d. If you are looking for a great
starting point, there is no better place to look.

My own changes include Typescript, Angular and React support, and some
functions to mimic the behaviours from my previous IDEs. Feel free to
fork, use and ask some questions. I'll do what I can to get back to you.

Emacs itself comes with support for many programming languages. This
config adds improved defaults and extended support for the following:

* Ruby / Ruby on Rails
* CSS / LESS / SASS / SCSS
* HAML / Markdown / Textile / ERB
* Clojure (with Cider and nRepl)
* Javascript / Coffeescript
* Python
* PHP
* Haskell
* Elm
* Erlang
* Common Lisp (with Slime)

In particular, there's a nice config for *autocompletion* with
[company](https://company-mode.github.io/), and
[flycheck](http://www.flycheck.org) is used to immediately highlight
syntax errors in Ruby, Python, Javascript, Haskell and a number of
other languages.

## Supported Emacs versions

The config should run on Emacs 24.1 or greater and is designed to
degrade smoothly - see the Travis build - but note that Emacs 24 and
above is required for an increasing number of key packages, including
`magit`, `company` and `flycheck`, so to get full you should use the
latest Emacs version available to you.

Some Windows users might need to follow
[these instructions](http://xn--9dbdkw.se/diary/how_to_enable_GnuTLS_for_Emacs_24_on_Windows/index.en.html)
to get TLS (ie. SSL) support included in their Emacs.

## Other requirements

To make the most of the programming language-specific support in this
config, further programs will likely be required, particularly those
that [flycheck](https://github.com/flycheck/flycheck) uses to provide
on-the-fly syntax checking.

## Installation

To install, clone this repo to `~/.emacs.d`, i.e. ensure that the
`init.el` contained in this repo ends up at `~/.emacs.d/init.el`:

```
git clone https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d
```

Upon starting up Emacs for the first time, further third-party
packages will be automatically downloaded and installed. If you
encounter any errors at that stage, try restarting Emacs, and possibly
running `M-x package-refresh-contents` before doing so.
